conflict test - local
This change is made from GitHub GUI to simulate a conflict.

### This is a test update after 'git pull --no-rebase origin main' to merge remote changes into local.
### Both versions are kept intentionally to demonstrate conflict resolution. Conflict markers were removed manually.
